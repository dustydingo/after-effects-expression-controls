# Global Masking

Global masking is the process through which a series of layers in a composition can be "masked" using a single layer or shape object. This will be achieved using the "Set Matte" plugin:

1. identify the layer that requires masking and the layer that will serve as a mask
2.  the layer that will serve as a mask can be a image/video/shape object
3. apply the "Set Matte" effect on the layer that requires masking
4. from the settings of the effect choose the layer that serves as the mask
5. keyframe the mask as required
6. by default the effect adds to the layer that requires masking, but using the settings you can "invert" in order to subtract if you require an opposite mask
