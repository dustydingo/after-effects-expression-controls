# Essential Graphics

Essential graphics are one of the most useful features when using after effects with premiere. They allow you to set adjustable/variable parameters that can be adjusted within premiere without having to go into after effects.

To use essential graphics:
1. select "window" from the menu bar > choose "essential graphics"
2. choose your "master" composition, which would serve as the layer that would appear in premiere
3. from whichever layer you select choose any parameter from the layer (for example, you can choose transform > scale) and drag the parameter to after effects
4. you can name and modify each parameter to your specification
5. once you have adjusted your parameters choose "export motion graphics template"
6. once the template has been exported you can simply drag it into premiere and use it, with the ability to modify the parameters to your specification
7. done
